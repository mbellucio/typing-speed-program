## About this project 📌
This project's idea is to create a software that<br>
allows the user to train it`s typing speed in<br>
a practical way.<br><br>

The program only counts the correct typed words<br>
and generates randomly these words in order to<br>
challenge the user everytime he plays the program.<br><br>

The user has 60 seconds to type as many words as he can.<br>
After the timer is down, the program gives the user<br>
a feedback on how many correct WPM(Words per minute)<br>
the user has typed. The user can also click the<br>
"Check Words" button to receive a visual feedback<br>
of the words he typed right and wrong.<br>
